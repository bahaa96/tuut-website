Most probably I use Figma Make to build my pages from Figma designs to code, and I get it here and put it as a SP React version, and I ask you to turn it into a next page to fit in this project. Which is the project I serve my app from? So, please follow the following things while doing this conversion.

- dont change any page content, components or styling
- respect me when I change anything manually in the code base don't get it back
- when creating a new page make it follow the same design system and styling patterns of the website
- whenever you finish a prompt check syntax errors and fix it
